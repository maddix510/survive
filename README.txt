Hello, this is my first coding project I'm making besides the one I already made documenting where I'm at while I'm learning to code, but this will be my first real coding project, right now  I'm still planning and coming up with ideas but the main idea will it will be a text based choose your own asventure game with multiple paths and endings, it will be titled survive and the story is that all of the sudden your character working their job and being informed of a zombie outbreak and having to survive, make friends, or even in one path save everyone. I might do 2-5 updates a week, these will be small, maybe adding one or more choices and what they do.
